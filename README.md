# 2DIsingmodel
In this project, several questions under the scheme of 2D Ising model was simulated.
NOTE: The questions themselves were given by Dr Ding Pan and Dr Tianwen Chen at HKUST.

Here are the questions:
In a 20x20 lattices,
Q1: Let the interaction const J be 1, temperature T  and Boltzmann Const both be 1. Perform Monte-carlo simulation for the lattice for several steps.
Q2: Calculate the spontaneous magnetization vs. steps (or time in monte-carlo) for Q1.
Q3: Repeat Q2 for several times, check the sign of spontaneous magnetization. (positive or negative?)
Q4: Visualize Q2/Q3 using Dynamiclattice.py with different temperatures.
